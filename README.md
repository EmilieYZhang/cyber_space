# cyber_space
> With Cyber_Space, we want to encourage cyber security awareness by allowing the users to create their own (very hilarious) stories!

_To put it simply, you have the power to customize your own adventure as you explore the world of cyber threats._

Three easy steps to have fun while learning:

1. Choose a story.
2. Without knowing the pre-written story at all, you blindly fill in the blanks with fun words, verbs, adjectives, etc.
3. Read the hilarious story aloud! It is customized and riddled with words you had just filled in. An absolutely hilarious experience, and an effective way to educate yourself about the danger of cyber attacks.
